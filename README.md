# Heart Rate Animation

This project demonstrates a heart rate animation using SVG graphics and CSS animations. The animation features a pulsating heart shape and a heartbeat line that animates to create a visual representation of a heartbeat.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure and includes links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains styling and animation keyframes for the SVG elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for any future functionality (currently empty).

## Files Overview

### `index.html`

This file contains:
- An SVG element with two paths: one for the heartbeat line and one for the heart shape.
- Links to the external CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.

### `style.css`

This file includes:
- Styles for centering the SVG element on the page.
- Keyframes for the `blink` animation, which makes the heart shape pulse.
- Keyframes for the `dash` animation, which animates the heartbeat line.

### `script.js`

This file is currently empty but can be used to add JavaScript functionality if needed.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the heart rate animation.
3. Customize the `style.css` file to adjust the appearance and animation of the SVG elements.
4. Add JavaScript to `script.js` if you need additional interactivity.

## Example

To view the animation, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. The heart shape will pulse, and the heartbeat line will animate in sync with the heart shape.
